				<p>
					Anton Alley grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, IL with 5 siblings. He is currently at BYU studying computer science. 
					The purpose of this Portfolio is to give a brief overview of the projects that he's worked on and what he learned from them.

					<h3>Byepolar.tv: React.js and Firebase App</h3>
					<em>Ongoing</em>
					<div class="project-detail">
						<div class="details">
							<p>
								Byepolar.tv is a web app that I am currently developing with Devin Jernigan as the Product Manager. It is a place for people
								to come together and discuss typically contreversial topics in a way that they can see all sides of the argument and gain 
								trust and respect for other people. It is the first time that I have used firebase, and it has proved to be very useful,
								as I am using the realtime database, authentication, and hosting from it. I also learned how to use github actions to 
								automatically deploy updates to the production site as I pull request them into the Production Branch, which has been really
								cool to use. The hardest part about this project is video call, because we are trying to get people to discuss online through
								video call, and it is difficult to do this when we want to do it in a very customized way, and on a tight budget(zero).

					<h3>Lonomo: Swift iOS mobile development</h3>
					<em>Fall 2022</em>
					<div class="project-detail">
						<div class="details">
							<p>
								Lonomo was project I was working on for a few months fall 2022. I wanted to create a social event app to help people make more friends doing 
								hobbies they love to do. I learned swift from scratch for this project, and learned how to connect it to the backend, which I created using 
								the Django-rest framework in python, complete with authentication and api endpoints. I was also in a user experience course while I was
								designing this app, so I spent extra care on the design, and fully designed it in Figma before implementing it in code. I did user testing
								with the user experience as well, had about a dozen people test it

					<h3>Needs First: Hackathon Full-stack application</h3>
					<em>Oct 2022</em>
					<div class="project-detail">
						<div class="details">
							<p>
								Along with a product manager, Devin Jernigan, and a designer, Cedric Lancy, and I as the engineer, we created this 
								application under 8 hours for a competition to get into the Sandbox program at BYU. The idea behind it was a 
								marketplace to rent out medical equipment, so I created a live linux server running react on the front end, 
								and Django-rest on the backend to create this interactive website.

					<h3>Snakes AI: Genetic Algorithm Machine Learning</h3>
					<em>Early 2019</em>
					<div class="project-detail">
						<div class="details">
							<p>
								I did this project when I first learned about machine learning. I got really excited about neural networks, and I wanted
								to figure everything out about them that I could. Being a novice programmer, I wanted to do it all without any external 
								machine learning libraries, so I did it from scratch. I had to use linear algebra for the neural network, but the backpropigation
								techiniques were over my head at this point, so that's why I looked into genetic algorithms. It is definetly not the most 
								effective, as you can see in the video it doesn't get super far. But at the same time it was really cool because I didn't
								program any stragegy or rules into it, all it took into account was the state of the board, and the neural network trained
								simply by a random genetic algorithm thousands of time overnight on my old janky laptop, and it learned as much as it did.
								Even though not super impressive, this project got me really excited about machine learning and its possibilities.
							</p>

								The graph shows an example of the fitness over epochs of training.
